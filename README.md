 Power BI Dashboard Project: Product Performance & Supply Chain Efficiency ðŸ“Š

I'm excited to share a recent project where I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into both product performance and supply chain efficiency. This project combines a range of visualizations, helping businesses better understand key metrics that drive their operations.

Key Features:
Product Sales Analysis: Bar charts displaying product sales by category.
Revenue Trends: Line charts visualizing revenue generated over time.
Price Distribution: Histograms showing price variations across different product types.
Stock Levels: Heat maps to monitor SKU and product stock levels.
Lead Time vs. Order Quantities: Scatter plots analyzing supplier lead times and order quantities.
Shipping Costs & Carrier Performance: Bar charts to track shipping costs across different carriers and locations.
Manufacturing Efficiency: Dual-axis charts comparing lead times with production volumes.
Customer Demographics: Demographic breakdowns and revenue analysis by customer segments.

By using this dashboard, businesses can gain deeper insights into their operational performance and identify opportunities for improvement in areas like supply chain management, pricing strategies, and customer targeting.
